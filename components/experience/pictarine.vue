    <p>
      I make tools for my teammates using VueJs Framework, Python Flask and
      Google cloud platform. My first job is to maintain the backend part,
      design and build Apis, write unit tests and integration tests and set up a
      CI to secure and automate production. My second job is to create powerful
      tools from frontend to backend allowing the different teams to optimize
      their work by using it. Today, the Marketing, Support and Customer
      Development teams work with my tools.
